---
I am Paul Raadnui, a masters student at the University of British Columbia. 
Throughout my years of studying at Penn State and working as a geophysicist at PTTEP, I have always been passionate about combining 
my technical foundation with a strong passion for data science and applying coding skills to solve complex geophysical problems 
and accelerate workflows. 

I am eager to fully transition into the field of data science and hope to utilize my skills to address real-world scientific challenges 
and provide futuristic data-driven solutions.
